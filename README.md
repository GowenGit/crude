# A lightweight **Blazor** component to auto generate **CRUD** forms and list views.

*CRUD.e* is a simple NuGet package you can drop into your existing Blazor projects and it will generate all the boilerplate CRUD code for you.

The library is designed to use no JavaScript and very little CSS (mainly vanilla grid layout). The main goal is to produce a clean HTML structure with no unnecessary markup or code.

## Supported Field Types

* [x] Numeric
* [x] Boolean
* [x] String
* [x] Enum
* [x] DateTime, DateTimeOffset
